# Glide4Baby10
Glide4Baby10 is a basic glide/portamento circuit with PCB made in DIY Layout Creator

First things first : Original circuit schematic can be found at this post https://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?highlight=glide+portamento&t=35379

I made a couple of modifications which worked for my project.
This glide circuit is part of a Baby-10 sequencer project.

The only thing I can brag for is the actual PCB that I crafted myself as a personal learning tutorial 
on DIY Layout Creator software.
