# Glide4Baby10

## Glide4Baby10 is a basic glide/portamento circuit with PCB made in DIY Layout Creator

1. First things first : Original circuit schematic can be found in this post at [electro-music.com](https://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?highlight=glide+portamento&t=35379)

2. I made a couple of modifications that worked for my Baby-10 sequencer project

3. The modified circuit was breadboarded and worked like a charm
- I replaced the TL072 Op-Amp with an LM358 which resulted in less noisy output signal.
- I replaced the 1uF electrolytic capacitor C1 for a 0.1 uF K63 film capacitor for better results at gliding voltage-range output.

4. The only thing I can brag for is the actual PCB that I crafted myself as a personal learning tutorial on DIY Layout Creator software
